![Zcript example](https://github.com/gsysko/Zcript/blob/2f1a8aff3e83e11f6d7dccfa40120a6f0f66fd04/example.gif)

Zcript is a conversation builder plugin for Figma. It works with the [Conversation Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1121821259789181229) library to assemble a conversation between two participants. (N.b. this plugin is intended for internal use only, it will not work with the community version of the Conversation Kit.)
